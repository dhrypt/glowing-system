# Glowing System

**Glowing System** is a simple Three.js project that demonstrates the creation of a rotating icosahedron with a wireframe overlay. This project is built using HTML, JavaScript, and the Three.js library, showcasing a basic 3D object rendered in the browser.

## Features

- A rotating icosahedron geometry rendered using Three.js.
- Flat shading applied to the icosahedron for a stylized look.
- Wireframe overlay to emphasize the geometric structure.
- Orbit controls to interact with the 3D object (rotate, zoom, pan).
- Ambient lighting using HemisphereLight for a more dynamic visual effect.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that sets up the document structure and includes the necessary scripts.
- **index.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the Three.js logic to create, render, and animate the icosahedron.
